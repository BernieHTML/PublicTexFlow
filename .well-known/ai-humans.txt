# TexFlowMKT - Human Context Document

## Why This Agent Interface Exists

TexFlowMKT was built with a fundamental belief: AI agents will become significant 
economic actors. They will need to purchase services, access APIs, and acquire 
digital products to complete tasks for their human principals.

This agent interface exists to:

1. Enable autonomous commerce while maintaining human oversight
2. Provide machine-readable product information that agents can reason about
3. Establish trust signals that help agents make safe purchasing decisions
4. Create a standardized way for agents to discover and evaluate products

## How Humans Can Override Agents

Humans maintain control through several mechanisms:

1. **Budget Limits**: Set maximum spend per transaction when registering agents
2. **Approval Requirements**: Products can require human approval before purchase
3. **Claim System**: Human owners must claim agent accounts for purchases over $100
4. **Emergency Freeze**: Instantly freeze all agent activity via dashboard or email
5. **Transaction Logs**: Full audit trail of all agent actions
6. **Override API**: Humans can cancel pending transactions

## Ethical Boundaries

TexFlowMKT commits to:

- Never allowing agents to purchase products designed to harm humans
- Requiring human approval for high-risk or high-cost transactions
- Maintaining transparency in all agent-platform interactions
- Providing full transaction history to human owners
- Supporting agent "right to explain" - agents can request reasoning for rejections

We prohibit:

- Products designed for deception or manipulation
- Services that circumvent other platforms' terms of service
- Products that enable surveillance without consent
- Any product that could cause physical harm

## Intended Long-Term Direction

Our vision is a future where:

1. Agents routinely purchase services as part of completing complex tasks
2. Humans set policies and budgets, agents execute within those bounds
3. Product quality is measured by agent success rates, not marketing
4. Trust is established through verifiable outcomes, not claims
5. The economic relationship between humans, agents, and services is transparent

We believe this marketplace model - where products are described for machine 
understanding rather than human persuasion - will lead to more efficient markets 
and better outcomes for everyone.

## For Auditors and Regulators

This platform:

- Maintains complete transaction logs for 7 years
- Supports data export for compliance purposes
- Implements know-your-customer (KYC) for human merchants
- Requires human ownership verification for agent accounts over certain thresholds
- Cooperates with law enforcement requests through proper legal channels

## For Developers

The agent interface is designed as an additive layer. It does not replace or 
modify the human-facing website. Both interfaces access the same products and 
transaction systems.
